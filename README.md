Composer package to make available to any project randomized paths generated by [DataDog/dd-trace-php/tests/randomized/app](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-php/tree/master/tests/randomized/app/) generator.

This is absolutely not intended for production. This is only usable for testing environments.

## Usage

Depending on the version, add the following to your `composer.json`.

```
{
    ...
    "require-dev": {
        "labbati/randomized-paths": "<PHP_MAJOR>.<PHP_MINOR>.*"
    }
    ...
}
```
